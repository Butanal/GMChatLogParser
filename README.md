# GMLogParser
Ugly but functional Garry's Mod logfile chat parser (garrysmod/logs)

There are already GMod addons that log in-game new chat messages, but none that parse the existing chat logs to extract past messages.
This module aims to solve this by creating a simple-to-use class, either to manually obtain chat logs or to export them into a newer system.

See example_logprint.py for a simple example on how to use this.
